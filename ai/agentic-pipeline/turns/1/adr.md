# Architecture Decision Record

Initialize Ignore Rules and Turn Tracking

**Turn**: 1

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-10-22 - 00:39

**Context**
The repository lacked a `.gitignore` file and the governance model requires turn-tracking artifacts (changelog, ADR, manifest, session context, and index) for each turn. Establishing these artifacts is necessary before generating SQL outputs.

**Options Considered**
1. Proceed without creating a `.gitignore` or tracking files until later turns.
2. Create the `.gitignore` and initialize the required governance tracking artifacts immediately.

**Decision**
Option 2 was selected to comply with governance requirements and prevent committing build or environment artifacts in future work. The `.gitignore` provides standard exclusions for Python, Node, logs, and agent artifacts. The turn tracking files were created within `ai/agentic-pipeline/turns/1/` to capture the state of this turn.

**Result**
- Added `.gitignore` with baseline rules.
- Created changelog, ADR, manifest, session context values, and turn index entries for Turn 1.

**Consequences**
- The project now has guardrails against committing temporary or generated files.
- Future turns have the necessary scaffolding for logging and governance compliance.
- Slight upfront overhead to maintain these tracking files moving forward.
