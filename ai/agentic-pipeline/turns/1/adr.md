# Architecture Decision Record

MySQL DDL generation for CustomerProfile schema

**Turn**: 1

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-10-22 - 05:33

**Context**
The task requires producing normalized SQL assets from the CustomerProfile JSON schema while the user configuration specifies the MySQL dialect. Existing task guidance referenced PostgreSQL, leading to a dialect conflict that needed resolution.

**Options Considered**
1. Follow task markdown literally and emit PostgreSQL 16 statements.
2. Honor the user-provided MySQL configuration while aligning with normalization and indexing expectations.

**Decision**
Proceed with MySQL 8-compatible DDL that satisfies the schemaâ€™s requirements and mirrors the normalization practices outlined in the task guidance. This preserves user intent and still fulfills governance expectations.

**Result**
Generated `db/migrations/01_customer_profile_tables.sql`, `db/scripts/customer_profile_test_data.sql`, and supporting documentation describing execution against MySQL.

**Consequences**
- Positive: The produced assets are immediately usable in MySQL environments, matching the requested configuration.
- Negative: Divergence from the PostgreSQL examples may require future updates to align shared documentation with dialect-specific nuances.
